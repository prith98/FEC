## Primary Technologies

This project's client app was built using the following primary technologies

- **ReactJS**
    - Frontend javascript framework used to build the user interface. Built with functional components to utilize hooks and efficiently pass down props and state through context
- **Babel**
    - Transpilation package used to convert ReactJS-specific syntax into browser-consumable JavaScript.
- **Webpack**
    - Bundling package used to bundle javascript modules and component-focused stylesheets into ```.js``` and ```.css``` bundles for browser comsumption.

## My Features

- Users can search for questions for the current product with the search bar. After the 3rd character is inputted, the displayed questions will dynamically filter
based on whether or not the question contains the search query
- Users can give their input on the helpfulness of a question or answer by clicking on a specifc text. Users can only Like or Report a specific Question/Answer
once per session. If the user tries to do one of those actions twice, they will get an alert saying they've already done that specific action this session
- Users can add their own question by clicking on the Add Question button. A pop up modal will display where the user enters their name, email, and question.
If all three of these fields are not filled out, the user will not be able to submit the form
- Users can add their own answers by clicking on the Add Answer text located in each specific question box. A pop up modal will display where the user enters their name, email, and answer.
